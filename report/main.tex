{\Large The traffic effects of cooperating autonomous vehicles: Executive summary}
\end{center}

Dear Governor of Washington,

\doublespacing{
  \setlength\parindent{36pt}

  We have created a program that models individual vehicles on a highway. We have mixed different kinds drivers, including multiple cooperating autonomous vehicles strategies, multiple human drivers strategies (from Treiber and Gipps), and some random driver strategies. We chose conditions similar vehicle density and velocities to those that exist in a traffic jam.

  Unfortunately our program did not scale up to the conditions of the given highways. We need further research in order to reach more concrete results.
}
  
Yours Sincerely,

\qquad Team \#\teamnumber
